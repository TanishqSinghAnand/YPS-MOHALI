    <h3>Affiliation</h3>    
    <p>
        YPS is a co-educational day-cum boarding school from nursery to class XII. It is affiliated to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination, New Delhi. Indian School Certificate (Class XII) is treated as equivalent to the Senior School Examination of the University of Scotland. This implies that pupil will not be required to obtain “A” level qualifications, or to complete bridging courses, while seeking entry to Universities in the UK and other overseas Universities in the Commonwealth. (Indian School Certification is the only qualification from India that has been granted this special recognition).
        
        YPS is a member of the Indian Public School Conference. The Academic session of the school is from April to March.
