                It is often said that education without a clear cut aim is like a rudderless ship.

                

                At Yadavindra Public School, Mohali, we believe that education should not merely equip an individual to adjust with society to its customs and conventions, instead it should enable the child to bring desirable changes in society.

                We endeavour to enable our children to attain the greatest possible harmony, internal and external, spiritual and material, for the fullest possible development of human potentialities and capacities.

                We aim to equip our students to move, adapt and acclimatise with changing times and become true global citizens.

                

                I wish the entire YPS family the best.
